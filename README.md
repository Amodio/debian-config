debian-config: My config files to run a fresh debian (netinstall)
==============

Preview
-------

Take a look at the result in the screenshot file: `screenshot.jpg`.


Installation
------------

After the installation of Debian (without the graphical environment but
with the OpenSSH server), you will have to fetch my config files like this:
```
wget https://github.com/Amodio/debian-config/archive/master.zip
aptitude install unzip
unzip master.zip
```
Then read the `INSTALL` file.

Hope you'll like it; I enjoy feedbacks (bugs, etc).
